#Content-Creation-and-Summarization

## Overview

The Content-Creation-and-Summarization is a powerful, interactive web application that leverages **Hugging Face Transformers** to provide two core functionalities: **intelligent content generation** and **efficient text summarization**. This studio allows users to quickly draft creative text, expand on ideas, or distill lengthy documents into concise summaries, all powered by state-of-the-art language models.

It features a clean, intuitive interface, making advanced NLP capabilities accessible to writers, researchers, marketers, and anyone needing AI assistance with text.

## Features

  * **‚ú® Content Generation:**
      * Generate diverse text based on a user-provided prompt.
      * Powered by **GPT-2**, a robust transformer model.
      * Fine-tune generation with parameters like `max_length`, `temperature`, `num_sequences`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `no_repeat_ngram_size`, and `seed` for controlled creativity.
  * **üìö Text Summarization:**
      * Condense long articles, reports, or notes into succinct summaries.
      * Utilizes **T5-small**, an efficient sequence-to-sequence model optimized for summarization.
      * Control summary length with `min_length` and `max_length` settings.
  * **Responsive User Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a seamless web experience.
  * **Model Caching:** Uses `st.cache_resource` to load models only once, ensuring fast subsequent interactions and efficient resource usage.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the LLM Content Studio up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vinay2024/llm-content-studio.git
    cd llm-content-studio
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

Once dependencies are installed, you can launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run your_app_file_name.py
```

*(Assuming your Streamlit code is in a file named `your_app_file_name.py`)*

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1.  **Navigate between tabs:** Use the "‚ú® Content Creation" and "üìö Text Summarization" tabs to switch functionalities.

2.  **Content Creation:**

      * Enter your desired **prompt** in the text area.
      * Adjust **generation parameters** using the sliders and input fields.
      * Click "üöÄ Generate Content" to see the AI-generated text.

3.  **Text Summarization:**

      * Paste your **long text** into the designated text area.
      * Set your preferred **minimum and maximum summary lengths**.
      * Click "‚úçÔ∏è Generate Summary" to get the condensed version of your text.

## Technical Details

  * **Models Used:**
      * **Content Generation:** `gpt2`
      * **Text Summarization:** `t5-small`
  * **Libraries:** `streamlit`, `transformers`
  * **Caching:** `st.cache_resource` is used to prevent redundant model loading, significantly improving performance after the initial load.
  * **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is in place for model loading and generation failures.
